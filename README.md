Kindly desist from sharing your solution privately or publicly. This is because the programming task is not complex for those who've written non-trivial amount of code before. But for beginners, solving this can be quite instructive - frustrating at times, but rewarding in the end.

But if you share your solution with them - through a GitHub repo, or by circulating in your private networks, you're only robbing them of a rewarding experience that would have helped them grow as programmers.

It is trivial to detect copy-cat code submissions and students who submit plagiarized code will be unable to find a place among the limited seats in the course. It is just that it'll take us a few more moments to read through the code and tag it. A lose-lose proposition for all concerned.

We wish you best of luck and look forward to reading your code submissions!
